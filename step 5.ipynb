    "# Step 5: PageRank\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of you may already know PageRank computation by its reputation:  it is used to measure the importance of a Web page.  (Contrary to popular belief, PageRank is named after Larry Page, not Web pages…)  PageRank is actually a tweaked version of a network centrality measure called *eigenvector centrality*.  One way to implement PageRank is as an iterative computation.  We take each graph node $x$ and in iteration 0 assign it a corresponding PageRank $p_x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p_x^0= 1 / N$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the total number of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in each iteration $i$ we recompute:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p_x^{(i)} = \\alpha * \\Sigma_{j \\in B(x)} (1 / N_j) p_j^{(i-1)} + \\beta$\n",
    "\n",
    "![Graph](graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $B(x)$ is the set of nodes linking to node $x$, and $N_j$ is the outdegree of each such node $j$.  Typically, repeating the PageRank computation for a number of iterations (15 or so) results in convergence within an acceptable tolerance.  For this assignment we’ll assume $\\beta = 0.15$ and $\\alpha = 0.85$ (anecdoctally these are the most common values used in practice).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*. In the figure to the right, nodes $j_1$ and $j_2$ represent the back-link set $B(x)$ for node $x$.  $N_{j1}$ is 3 and $N_{j2}$ is 2.  Thus in each iteration $i$, we recompute the PageRank score for $x$ by adding half of the PageRank score for $j_2$ and a third of the PageRank score of $j_3$ (both from the previous iteration $i-1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*.  Build some “helper” DataFrames.  We suggest at least 2 DataFrames, where the first is used the build the second, and the second is used in your solution:\n",
    "1. a DataFrame with each from_node and the proportion of weight it transfers to each outgoing edge.  For instance, if the from_node is node j then the proportion of weight should be $1/N_j$.\n",
    "2. a DataFrame, again with the from_node, each node it transfers weight to, and the proportion of weight computed in (1).  For instance, if the `from_node` is $j$ and the to_node is $x$, then the tuple should be $(j, x, 1/N_j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Submission*. See the external document for submission information.  Remember to first do the basic part of **Homework 2**."
